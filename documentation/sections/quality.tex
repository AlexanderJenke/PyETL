The software is developed according to the waterfall model.
\begin{itemize}
\item In the first step the task was analyzed and requirements for the software were documented.

\item Secondly the software structure was designed. 
In this step, the software was split into the three subsections: ETL-Process, Prediction-Pipeline, and front-end.
Interfaces, in form of database structures, were defined. 

\item In the third step, the sub-modules were implemented separately.

\item In the fourth step, the sub-modules were firstly tested independently and afterward the complete pipeline was evaluated.

\item The last step, the commissioning is prepared but not executed.

\end{itemize}
On completion of a step the fulfillment of the requirements of the preceding step were verified.
On implementation the sub-modules were split into smaller tasks, which were implemented and tested on its own, followed by a system test verifying the correct operation of the task in the complete system.
